In the project, I used react core concepts JSX, Components, Props, Event, State, UseEffect, router, router hooks, dynamic routing etc. This project help me to learn more about routing pages using react.

### My project Concept and features

I try to build a simple react MPA based on English learning courses information. In my project, Header section shows navigation of four pages are home,about,courses,contact.
Header and Footer section is same for all pages.Body section will change depending on necessary information.
In home page, At first top section start with course title and then there are some cards of popular courses.When navigate to courses page, more courses card will appear. Then in about page, instructor and course related details information is describe. Lastly, in contact page, there is necessary option like email,phone-number,address for connect.
when try to visit any page that does not exist site will show 404 error.

In future, I will try to add more features in page and update my MPA.
